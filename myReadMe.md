To whom it may concern!

This is a file to help you navigate the organisation
of my files.
Other than the App.tsx I did not create any other components.
However all the functions that are used to calculate the delivery cost are in woltexcercise/src/modules.
I created so many typescript files because I wanted for the code to be easily readable and easily maintanable.

So the deliveryDistanceModule.ts file contains the funcion that modifies the delivery fee based on the distance.

The deliveryItemsModule.ts file contains the functions that modifies the delivery fee based on how many items are in the basket.

The rushTimeModule.ts contains the function that modifies the delivery fee based on the time of delivery.

The file deliveryCostCalculator.ts is the complete function that calcutes the delivery fee based on all the parameters.

For styling I used the bulma css library.

The code has been tested thorghouly and based on my tests the results are always correct . 
I tried to level up the styling a bit as well however the most effort and focus was given to the logic part of the code.
